~~Requires the menu/gui of https://github.com/Unblonded/packet-edit-menu~~

We had to move away from using c++ injection for a few reasons:
1. caused antivirus conflicts
2. now allows us to have more powerful menu function
3. faster menu rendering time when opening Gui


Beside all this shit above:
this client has lots of insparation from meteor client, cus i ran out of ideas half way.
reguarding that the client works very well it has a powerful looking gui, and saves configs
in a folder in your game work directory ex. ```.minecraft/packet-edit/config.json```

Please Enjoy the client honestly, it took a lot of work and sleepless nights.
Also feel free to use this with feather/lunar client or any other mods including any
other cheats like meteor.

Usage:
press G on keyboard when in game - this can be remapped in the controls menu
